Example 23: ORPO (Odds Ratio Preference Optimization) Training

End-to-end ORPO training. ORPO combines SFT and preference learning into
a single training step, making it simpler and more memory-efficient than DPO.
No reference model is needed.

        },
        {
            "prompt": "What is Docker and why is it useful?",
            "chosen": "Docker is a platform for containerizing applications. Containers package your app with all its dependencies into a portable unit that runs consistently across environments. This solves the 'works on my machine' problem and simplifies deployment, scaling, and CI/CD workflows.",

            "prompt": "Explain the difference between HTTP and HTTPS.",
            "chosen": "HTTP (HyperText Transfer Protocol) sends data in plain text, while HTTPS adds TLS/SSL encryption to protect data in transit. HTTPS prevents eavesdropping and tampering, which is critical for login pages, payments, and any sensitive data. Modern browsers flag HTTP sites as 'Not Secure'.",

        },
        {
            "prompt": "What is a database index?",
            "chosen": "A database index is a data structure (usually a B-tree) that speeds up data retrieval by providing quick lookup paths to rows. Like a book's index, it maps values to their locations. Indexes speed up SELECT queries but slow down INSERT/UPDATE operations since the index must be maintained.",

Versioning (v1/v2) ensures backward compatibility.",

            "chosen": "Unit testing verifies individual components work correctly in isolation. Benefits include catching bugs early, enabling safe refactoring, serving as documentation, and providing confidence in code changes. Good unit tests are fast, independent, and cover both happy paths and edge cases.",

It helps compare algorithms — for example, binary search O(log n) is much faster than linear search O(n) for large inputs.",

            "chosen": "CSS Flexbox is a layout model for arranging items in one dimension (row or column). Key properties include display:flex on the container, justify-content for main axis alignment, align-items for cross axis, flex-wrap for wrapping, and flex-grow/shrink on children for sizing. It replaced many float-based hacks.",

            "prompt": "How does garbage collection work?",
            "chosen": "Garbage collection automatically frees memory that is no longer referenced by the program. Common approaches include reference counting (track how many pointers reference an object) and mark-and-sweep (traverse from roots, mark reachable objects, sweep unreachable ones). Languages like Python, Java, and Go use GC; C/C++ require manual memory management.",

            "prompt": "What is a hash table?",
            "chosen": "A hash table maps keys to values using a hash function that converts keys to array indices. Lookups, insertions, and deletions average O(1) time. Collisions (two keys mapping to the same index) are handled via chaining (linked lists) or open addressing. Python's dict and JavaScript's objects are hash tables.",

Since network partitions are inevitable, real systems choose between CP (e.g., MongoDB) or AP (e.g., Cassandra).",
